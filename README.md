# Dragon Shield Card Converter

## Getting started

Should be reasonably self-explanatory when you open the program. Pick the export from Dragon Shield as the input and specify an output file and click convert!

Export will be importable into deckbox.org which has a much better search tool than Dragon Shield (for now).
